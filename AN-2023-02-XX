New features with AN-2023-02-XX:

With great sadness we report the death of schilytools main author and
long time maintainer Jörg Schilling (1955-03-27--2021-10-10).  Jörg, we
miss you!  After his passing, development has been picked up by a group
of volunteers who would like to keep the project alive and well.  Our
goal is to carefully preserve the portability and compatibility of this
project while extending it to new platforms and implementing new tools
and features that fit the tool set.

As a part of the change in management, the schilytools project has moved
from Sourceforge to Codeberg.  Please report bugs and send patches to
our bug tracker:

	https://codeberg.org/schilytools/schilytools

or to our mailing list schilytools@mlists.in-berlin.de:

If you have previously reported bugs to Jörg Schilling and they have not
been fixed, please report them again.  We do not have access to Jörg's
private emails and do not know what you have reported.

NEW FEATURES:

-	star: remove some C99-only code accidentally introduced in the
	previous release.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS:

-	Schilytools contains pxupgrade, a dummy for a closed-source
	component.  While the source code of this component is available
	to the maintainer, it cannot be published due to an existing NDA
	with Plextor.  Depending on whether we can get this NDA lifted
	or not, the pxupgrade dummy code may either be replaced with the
	real source code of the tool or removed altogether.

-	With development of the p7zip(1) utility having ceased in 2016
	and the 7-zip project having ported the reference implementation
	to UNIX-like systems, many packagers now ship a 7z(1) command
	instead of p7zip(1).  Future star distributions may ship an
	/etc/default/star file configuring P7ZIP_CMD to refer to 7z(1)
	instead of the default p7zip(1).  This will not affect existing
	installations unless the configuration is updated.

-	Configuring compression/decompression helpers may be implemented
	for DOS (DJGPP) in an upcoming version.
