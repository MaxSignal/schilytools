With great sadness we report the death of schilytools main author and
long time maintainer Jörg Schilling (1955-03-27--2021-10-10).  Jörg, we
miss you!  After his passing, development has been picked up by a group
of volunteers who would like to keep the project alive and well.  Our
goal is to carefully preserve the portability and compatibility of this
project while extending it to new platforms and implementing new tools
and features that fit the tool set.

As a part of the change in management, the schilytools project has moved
from Sourceforge to Codeberg.  Please report bugs and send patches to
our bug tracker:

    https://codeberg.org/schilytools/schilytools

or to our mailing list schilytools@mlists.in-berlin.de:

    https://mlists.in-berlin.de/mailman/listinfo/schilytools-mlists.in-berlin.de

If you have previously reported bugs to Jörg Schilling and they have not
been fixed, please report them again.  We do not have access to Jörg's
private emails and do not know what you have reported.

UPDATING:

-	FreeBSD: The default location for configuration files on FreeBSD
	has been moved from /etc to be relative to INS_RBASE.  Users are
	advised to either move their configuration files or compile with
	INS_RBASE=/ to restore the old behaviour.

DEPRECATED FEATURES:

-	man2html: The man2html utility will be removed from schilytools
	in a future release.  Users who wish to continue using this
	utility are advised to use Thomas Dickey's version instead.

	    https://dickey.his.com/scripts/man2html.html

NEW FEATURES:

-	general: The schilytools are now maintained in a git repository
	at https://codeberg.org/schilytools/schilytools.git.  Artifacts
	of Jörg's prior SCCS use such as SCCS ident strings remain; they
	will likely be updated to use git's ident feature in the future.

-	general: Explain how to contribute and update README

-	general: Add list of contributors

-	general: Add findlinks.sh, .gitignore, and (re)generate .links
	The script scans the various MKLINKS files and generates
	appropriate .gitignore files in each affected directory.  At the
	same time, these links are recorded in the .links file kept for
	compatibility.

-	general: Add hand-written .gitignore file in root directory.
	This file holds ignored files that are not covered by the
	findlinks.s script as well as generic patterns for build
	artifacts.

-	all: Misc spelling fixes
	Submitted by Friedhelm Mehnert.

-	all: Update E-Mail address and project URL in many places.
	Jörg's old joerg@schily.net address is defunct and so is his
	postal address.  As a part of an ongoing documentation cleanup,
	these addresses have been replaced by our new project pages in
	many locations.

-	DEFAULTS: Switch FreeBSD default link mode to dynamic
	Dynamic link mode has been tested in the ports tree for over a
	year and has worked without flaw so far.

-	DEFAULTS: On FreeBSD, set INS_RBASE relative to INS_BASE
	FreeBSD user applications are not supposed to put their
	configuration files into /etc.

-	RULES: Honor C++WOPTS
	Fixing a previous oversight, C++ warning options are now applied
	as intended.

-	RULES: Do not warn about register in C++
 	The register keyword is deprecated in C++ and removed in C++17.
	Unfortunately it is widely used all throughout the code base.
	For now, avoid a slew of useless warnings by disabling this
	warning where possible.

-	RULES: Fix build on macOS 12.4

-	RULES: Fix emacs TAGS generation

-	RULES: add i386-openbsd-clang.rul
	This should permit compilation on modern OpenBSD using clang as
	the system compiler.

-	autoconf: Work around clang bug in #pragma weak detection.
	A clang compiler bug causing a crash in the configure test for
	#pragma weak has been worked around, permitting use of weak
	symbols when compiling with clang.

-	bsh: Implement ^L support
	Typing ^L in bsh will now clear the screen as already supported
	in a number of other shells.
	Submitted by Nico Sonack.

-	inc: Remove outdated MKLINKS script
	The affected source files haven't been links in a long time.

-	libmdigest: Add support for BLAKE2 digests
	Submitted by Nico Sonack.

-	libmdigest: Prefer intrinsic for bswap_32 over inline assembly
	This should improve performance slightly when compiling with gcc
	on i386 targets.

-	libmdigest: Work around clang bug in #pragma weak

-	libstreamar: add missing LIB_ICONV

-	mdigest: Add support for BLAKE2 digests
	Submitted by Nico Sonack.

-	mkisofs: No longer warn about Joliet being nonstandard.
	With the 2019 revision of ECMA 119, Joliet has been added as an
	annex to the standard.  Hence, the warning about Joliet being
	nonstandard is no longer appropriate.  Neverthless, the warning
	is kept in changed form as the recommendation to use Rockridge
	in conjunction with Joliet is still sound.
	Reported by Sam Trenholme.

-	sccs: fix harmless wrong use of strlcpy()

-	star: convert star_fat.c generation to MKLINKS

-	sunpro: fix lots of warnings

-	sunpro: remove lots dead code in Make/lib/vroot
	This code can restored later if needed.

-	sunpro: work around gcc 2.7.2 shortcomings
	This pre-standard C++ compiler does not support extern "C"
	qualified typedefs.  Work around this shortcoming by placing the
	typedef inside an extern "C" { ... } block.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS:

-	RULES: symbol versioning will be enabled for FreeBSD after
	sufficient testing.

-	man2html: The utility will be removed in a future version (see
	DEPRECATED FEATURES).
