New features with AN-2023-01-12:

With great sadness we report the death of schilytools main author and
long time maintainer Jörg Schilling (1955-03-27--2021-10-10).  Jörg, we
miss you!  After his passing, development has been picked up by a group
of volunteers who would like to keep the project alive and well.  Our
goal is to carefully preserve the portability and compatibility of this
project while extending it to new platforms and implementing new tools
and features that fit the tool set.

As a part of the change in management, the schilytools project has moved
from Sourceforge to Codeberg.  Please report bugs and send patches to
our bug tracker:

	https://codeberg.org/schilytools/schilytools

or to our mailing list schilytools@mlists.in-berlin.de:

If you have previously reported bugs to Jörg Schilling and they have not
been fixed, please report them again.  We do not have access to Jörg's
private emails and do not know what you have reported.

UPDATING:

-	Solaris 11.4: man pages are now installed according to BSD
	conventions.  Users may need to manually remove the following
	old man pages on update: streamarchive.4, makefiles.4,
	makerules.4, changeset.4, sccschangeset.4, sccsfile.4,
	and star.4.


NEW FEATURES:

-	libxtermcap/termcap: update to latest FreeBSD commit

-	libxtermcap/termcap.url: remove file containing outdated
	information about where to obtain a termcap file from.

-	RULES/os-sunos5.def: man pages will now be installed into
	BSD-style sections on Solaris >=11.4 and descendents.

-	BOOTSTRAP, README.compile: fix outdated cross references.
	Reported by: Friedhelm Mehnert.

-	smake: add new -V option to print the expanded value of macros.
	Shamelessly stolen from bmake, this option makes it easy to
	debug make macros and to use their values in scripts.
	Submitted by Nico Sonack.

-	RULES: add symlink for arm64 OpenBSD

-	smake: fix a bug where CURDIR was not set when smake was called
	with -C $path and $path was an absolute path.
	Reported by illiliti@protonmail.com.
	Submitted by Friedhelm Mehnert.

-	Bourne Shell: Fix bug where set -o notify or set -b would cause
	the shell to exit when ^C was pressed.
        Submitted by Nico Sonack.

-	star: add support for configuring compression and decompression
	helpers.  The command executed when a compression/decompression
	program is selected with the compress-program=name option can
	be configured using a new set of name_CMD=... options in
	/etc/default/star.  Refer to the new COMPRESSION section in
	star(1) for details.  This feature is currently not available on
	DOS (DJGPP).
	Submitted by Philipp Wellner.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS:

-	Schilytools contains pxupgrade, a dummy for a closed-source
	component.  While the source code of this component is available
	to the maintainer, it cannot be published due to an existing NDA
	with Plextor.  Depending on whether we can get this NDA lifted
	or not, the pxupgrade dummy code may either be replaced with the
	real source code of the tool or removed altogether.

-	With development of the p7zip(1) utility having ceased in 2016
	and the 7-zip project having ported the reference implementation
	to UNIX-like systems, many packagers now ship a 7z(1) command
	instead of p7zip(1).  Future star distributions may ship an
	/etc/default/star file configuring P7ZIP_CMD to refer to 7z(1)
	instead of the default p7zip(1).  This will not affect existing
	installations unless the configuration is updated.

-	Configuring compression/decompression helpers may be implemented
	for DOS (DJGPP) in an upcoming version.
