New features with AN-2022-11-XX:

With great sadness we report the death of schilytools main author and
long time maintainer Jörg Schilling (1955-03-27--2021-10-10).  Jörg, we
miss you!  After his passing, development has been picked up by a group
of volunteers who would like to keep the project alive and well.  Our
goal is to carefully preserve the portability and compatibility of this
project while extending it to new platforms and implementing new tools
and features that fit the tool set.

As a part of the change in management, the schilytools project has moved
from Sourceforge to Codeberg.  Please report bugs and send patches to
our bug tracker:

	https://codeberg.org/schilytools/schilytools

or to our mailing list schilytools@mlists.in-berlin.de:

If you have previously reported bugs to Jörg Schilling and they have not
been fixed, please report them again.  We do not have access to Jörg's
private emails and do not know what you have reported.

UPDATING:

-	Solaris 11.4: man pages are now installed according to BSD
	conventions.  Users may need to manually remove the following
	old man pages on update: streamarchive.4, makefiles.4,
	makerules.4, changeset.4, sccschangeset.4, sccsfile.4,
	and star.4.


NEW FEATURES:

-	libxtermcap/termcap: update to latest FreeBSD commit

-	libxtermcap/termcap.url: remove file containing outdated
	information about where to obtain a termcap file from.

-	RULES/os-sunos5.def: man pages will now be installed into
	BSD-style sections on Solaris >=11.4 and descendents.

-	BOOTSTRAP, README.compile: fix outdated cross references.
	Reported by: Friedhelm Mehnert.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS:

-	Schilytools contains pxupgrade, a dummy for a closed-source
	component.  While the source code of this component is available
	to the maintainer, it cannot be published due to an existing NDA
	with Plextor.  Depending on whether we can get this NDA lifted
	or not, the pxupgrade dummy code may either be replaced with the
	real source code of the tool or removed altogether.
